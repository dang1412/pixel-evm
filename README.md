# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/Lock.ts
```

```sh
npm install next react react-dom
```

Create the `src/app/page.tsx` code file.

Add to `package.json`

```json
"scripts": {
  "dev": "next dev",
  "build": "next build",
  "start": "next start",
  "test": "hardhat test",
  "compile": "hardhat compile",
  "deploy": "hardhat run scripts/deploy.js"
}
```

Run `npm run dev`, it will update the `tsconfig.json` file automatically.
